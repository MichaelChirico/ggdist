#' @param side Which side to place the slab on. `"topright"`, `"top"`, and `"right"` are synonyms
#' which cause the slab to be drawn on the top or the right depending on if `orientation` is `"horizontal"`
#' or `"vertical"`. `"bottomleft"`, `"bottom"`, and `"left"` are synonyms which cause the slab
#' to be drawn on the bottom or the left depending on if `orientation` is `"horizontal"` or
#' `"vertical"`. `"topleft"` causes the slab to be drawn on the top or the left, and `"bottomright"`
#' causes the slab to be drawn on the bottom or the right. `"both"` draws the slab mirrored on both
#' sides (as in a violin plot).
