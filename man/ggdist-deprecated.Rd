\section{Deprecated Arguments}{


Arguments to \code{stat_slabinterval()} deprecated in ggdist 3.1 are:
\itemize{
\item The \code{limits_function} argument: this was a parameter for determining the
function to compute limits of the slab in \code{stat_slabinterval()} and its
derived stats. This function is really an internal function only needed by
subclasses of the base class, yet added a lot of noise to the documentation,
so it was replaced with \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_limits()}.
}
