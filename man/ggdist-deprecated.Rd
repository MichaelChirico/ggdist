\section{Deprecated Arguments}{


Parameters for \code{stat_slabinterval()} and family deprecated as of ggdist 3.1 are:
\itemize{
\item The \code{.prob} argument, which is a long-deprecated alias for \code{.width}, was
removed in ggdist 3.1.
\item The \code{limits_function} argument: this was a parameter for determining the
function to compute limits of the slab in \code{stat_slabinterval()} and its
derived stats. This function is really an internal function only needed by
subclasses of the base class, yet added a lot of noise to the documentation,
so it was replaced with \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_limits()}.
\item The \code{limits_args} argument: extra stat parameters are now passed through to
the \code{...} arguments to \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_limits()}; use
these instead.
\item The \code{slab_function} argument: this was a parameter for determining the
function to compute slabs in \code{stat_slabinterval()} and its
derived stats. This function is really an internal function only needed by
subclasses of the base class, yet added a lot of noise to the documentation,
so it was replaced with \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_slab()}.
\item The \code{slab_args} argument: extra stat parameters are now passed through to
the \code{...} arguments to \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_slab()}; use
these instead.
\item The \code{interval_function} and \code{fun.data} arguments: these were parameters for determining the
function to compute intervals in \code{stat_slabinterval()} and its
derived stats. This function is really an internal function only needed by
subclasses of the base class, yet added a lot of noise to the documentation,
so it was replaced with \code{AbstractStatSlabInterval$compute_interval()}.
\item The \code{interval_args} and \code{fun.args} arguments: to pass extra arguments to
a \code{point_interval} replace the value of the \code{point_interval} argument with
a simple wrapper; e.g. \verb{stat_halfeye(point_interval = \\(...) point_interval(..., extra_arg = XXX))}
}

Parameters for \code{geom_slabinterval()} and family deprecated as of ggdist 3.1 are:
\itemize{
\item The \code{size_domain} and \code{size_range} arguments, which are long-deprecated aliases
for \code{interval_size_domain} and \code{interval_size_range}, were removed in ggdist 3.1.
